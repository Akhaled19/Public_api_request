# Public API Request

Azal Khaled's Public API Requests Project 5 as a TeamTreehouse Full Stack JavaScript Talent Path student.

## Project Description: 
Built an app for a fictional company called Awsome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. Used Random User Generator API to grab information for 12 random U.S.A based "employees," and use that data to build Awsome Startup prototype. This project demonstrates ability to work with public APIs, making API requests, and asynchronously handling data. 

## Project Features:
* Gets 12 random U.S.A based "employees" from the Rand User API and displays them in cards on the page 
* You can click on any card to get a pop up modal that displays more detailed information
* You can search the page by employee name, if the user name does not exist, a h2 message 'No user found.' will be displayed on the page  
* While in the modals you can click to move to the previous employee or the next employee 
* Modals have a close buttons

## Changes I made to styles/css: 
* created an h2 section for the 'No user found.' message
* Changed the border-radius to a get a rounded search bar in .search-input
* Changed the font size, style and color 
* Changed the body color, seach box, card color, and modal color to dark smoky black background coupled with a striking electric blue makeing this a winning color scheme

 ### Future updates
 1. Dob- Use the helper function to formate the dob (birthday) - app.js line 86
 2. Searchbox - when a user clears the search box using the small 'x' that appears next to the input,  display the original 12 employee cards
 3. api - include international employees and have their info formated like US employees 
 4.  search box - employees can be search by location
