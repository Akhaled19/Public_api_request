# Unit5-public_api_request
 Built an app for a fictional company called Awsome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. Used Random User Generator API to grab information for 12 random "employees," and use that data to build Awsome Startup prototype. This project demonstrates ability to work with public APIs, making API requests, and asynchronously handling data. 

 # Future updates
 1. Dob- Use the helper function to formate the dob (birthday) - app.js line 86
 2. Searchbox - when a user clears the search box using the small 'x' that appears next to the input,  display the original 12 employee cards
 3. api - include international employees and have their info formated like US employees 
 4.  search box - employees can be search by location
